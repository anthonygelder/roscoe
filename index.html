    <!-- You'll want to wrap both of these lines in their own p tag. Not 100% necessary, but it is a better practice. -->
    <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my site. You might be thinking to yourself "how the fuck did a dog create a website?" or maybe "when did dogs learn web developement?"" or perhaps you've landed on the most basic quandry of all: "have dogs always known how to use computers?" 
      <br>
      <br>
      Either way, I'm here to reassure you that this website will answer none of those questions. </p>

      <!-- You don't need the extra p tags around these. 
        p is a paragraph tag, it is used for text like you have above^^^.
        If you remove them, you will see it will not make a differnce. -->
